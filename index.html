        <h2>Coal-addicted India’s solar and wind farms save more lives than those in US and China</h2>
        <p>China, the US, and India are the world’s top carbon dioxide (CO2) emitters. However, a unit of solar or wind power installed in India will reduce CO2 emissions to a bigger extent than in China or the US; a gigawatt of renewable power installed in India can save ten times more lives than in North America and Europe, due to greater reduction in air pollution levels. These are the findings of a study led by researchers at Harvard University.</p>

          <h2>Fukushima Set To Become A $2.7 Billion Renewable Energy Hub</h2>
          <p>Almost nine years after the century's worst nuclear crisis - which by some counts has eclipsed Chernobyl in total radioactive emissions - nearly a thousand storage tanks are scattered across the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, holding a staggering 1.1 million tons of treated water used to keep its melted reactor cores cool while they rust in the sun.</p>

          <p>The global climate crisis could lead to more renewable electricity being generated by spurring faster wind speeds for the world’s growing number of windfarms, according to research.</p>

          <h2>Can we make steel without CO2 emissions using renewable hydrogen?</h2>
          <p>They are talking about ThyssenKrupp Steel's recent worlds first: "The Duisburg-based steel producer has launched a series of tests into the use of hydrogen in a working blast furnace. They are the first tests of their kind and are aimed at reducing significantly the CO2 emissions arising during steelmaking."</p>

        <h2>How the humble chairlift could revolutionize renewable energy</h2>
        <div>By Emily Pontecorvo on Nov 18, 2019</div>
        <p>What do you see when you imagine a zero-carbon future? Electric buses zipping by? Rolling hills covered with solar panels? Offshore wind farms towering over the sea? If batteries are part of your vision, good thinking. But there’s a promising, if whimsical, piece of the renewable energy puzzle that might be missing from your mental picture: the world of gravity energy storage.</p>
        <p>When the grid depends on clean but sporadic natural resources like wind and the sun, we’re going to need ways to capture any extra energy they produce so we can use it later. Lithium-ion batteries help solve that problem, but they have limitations. They degrade over time, and they aren’t suited to store energy for months-long periods, like a seasonal stretch of gray skies or motionless air.</p>
        <p>Enter gravity energy storage. Generating electricity using gravity is hardly a new concept — think of your classic hydropower plant, which captures the energy of falling water via a turbine. But some hydropower systems don’t just produce energy. A “pumped-storage” hydroelectric plant draws excess energy from the grid and uses it to pump water back up into an elevated reservoir where it can fall again. When full, the upper reservoir is like a charged battery, ready to be deployed for weeks or months at a time, depending on how much water it holds.</p>
        <p>The United States already uses pumped-storage hydropower. In fact, it currently accounts for 95 percent of our utility-scale energy storage. But it’s tough to add a new pumped-storage project to the grid — it requires building a dam and creating new reservoirs, which are expensive and politically unpopular. Two-thirds of existing pumped-storage hydropower plants were built in the 1970s and 1980s. Only one new plant has come online in the past fourteen years.</p>
        <p>But who needs water when there are all kinds of things we can slide down a mountain or drop off a cliff? Really, you can use almost any material for gravity energy storage, as long as it’s heavy, cheap, and you can figure out how to transport it up and down a steep slope.</p>
