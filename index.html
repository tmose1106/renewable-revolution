            <h2>Coal-addicted India’s solar and wind farms save more lives than those in US and China</h2>
            <p>China, the US, and India are the world’s top carbon dioxide (CO2) emitters. However, a unit of solar or wind power installed in India will reduce CO2 emissions to a bigger extent than in China or the US; a gigawatt of renewable power installed in India can save ten times more lives than in North America and Europe, due to greater reduction in air pollution levels. These are the findings of a study led by researchers at Harvard University.</p>

        <h2>How the humble chairlift could revolutionize renewable energy</h2>
        <p>What do you see when you imagine a zero-carbon future? Electric buses zipping by? Rolling hills covered with solar panels? Offshore wind farms towering over the sea? If batteries are part of your vision, good thinking. But there’s a promising, if whimsical, piece of the renewable energy puzzle that might be missing from your mental picture: the world of gravity energy storage.</p>

          <h2>Fukushima Set To Become A $2.7 Billion Renewable Energy Hub</h2>
          <p>Almost nine years after the century's worst nuclear crisis - which by some counts has eclipsed Chernobyl in total radioactive emissions - nearly a thousand storage tanks are scattered across the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, holding a staggering 1.1 million tons of treated water used to keep its melted reactor cores cool while they rust in the sun.</p>

          <h2>Renewable energy: climate crisis 'may have triggered faster wind speeds'</h2>
          <p>The global climate crisis could lead to more renewable electricity being generated by spurring faster wind speeds for the world’s growing number of windfarms, according to research.</p>

          <h2>Can we make steel without CO2 emissions using renewable hydrogen?</h2>
          <p>They are talking about ThyssenKrupp Steel's recent worlds first: "The Duisburg-based steel producer has launched a series of tests into the use of hydrogen in a working blast furnace. They are the first tests of their kind and are aimed at reducing significantly the CO2 emissions arising during steelmaking."</p>
